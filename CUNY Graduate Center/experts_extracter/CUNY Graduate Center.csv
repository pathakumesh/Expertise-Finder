Prior to joining the John Jay faculty in 2002, I worked as a research scientist at CASA, Columbia University.   Research and Teaching My primary research is on intimate partner abuse with a current focus on sexual coercion and coercive control. Trained as a clinical and community psychologist, the broader cultural context of gender and power always informs my research. As such, my research and teaching engage not only with the more traditional psychological factors believed to trigger domestic abuse, (e.g., jealousy) but also consider the larger political, economic, and socio-cultural factors that maintain or exacerbate the violence (e.g., social permission to be controlling). Much of my work is interdisciplinary and international/cross-cultural, and I partner with organizations that include lawyers, psychologists, sociologists, anthropologists, and health care professionals. Internationally, I’ve collaborated with scholars from India, Brazil, Malaysia, Morocco, and Spain. Currently, I am working on three projects. These are:   Investigating how male abusers use different tactics including coercive control and sexual coercion to achieve control over their female intimate partners  Examining how coercive control (and partner violence) is enacted in gay couples and how these dynamics may vary across gender and sexual orientation  Examining traumatic outcomes in survivors of intimate partner violence and sex trafficking   A second research and teaching area includes the integration of the arts in the teaching of psychology. Several teaching and performance projects involving opera, psychology, and theatre are underway. Students are integral to these varied projects, and I enjoy mentoring, writing, and collaborating with my students. The gender-culture context that informs my research also informs my pedagogy. I designed and lead two study abroad programs, one to Bali Indonesia, and the other to Rabat, Morocco. The Bali program introduces students to the cultural study of the self and the Morocco program examines gender and feminism in a non-Western context.   Clinical and Forensic Practice I am a practicing therapist and clinically, I am interested in feminist approaches to managing trauma, appropriate techniques for interviewing women with trauma, accurate screening for women in violent relationships, and ecologically valid measurement methods for court use and expert testimony. I routinely conduct psychological evaluations and provide expert witness testimony for survivors of partner violence, sex trafficking, and other violence for a wide variety of reasons including political asylum, therapy planning, civil and criminal litigation, and T-visas.   Relevant Links Domestic Violence: Methodologies in Dialogue http://www.upne.com/1555538293.html   Self-Determination and Women's Rights in Muslim Societies http://www.upne.com/1611682793.   Sexual Coercion Talk http://www.vera.org/chitra-raghavan-intimate-aggression-understanding-sexual-coercion  ",https://www.gc.cuny.edu/getattachment/ef327655-34ab-48a2-9373-513ec3af6532/Chitra-Raghavan,https://www.gc.cuny.edu/Page-Elements/Academics-Research-Centers-Initiatives/Doctoral-Programs/Psychology/Faculty-Bios/Chitra-Raghavan,domestic violence,intimate partner violence,sexual assault,sexual harassment,sex trafficking,Intimate partner violence,sexual assault,gender and cultural dynamics,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We make quantitative measures of the behavior of live animals and use those to infer models of the underlying cognitive information processing mechanisms. We then implement these models into biomimetically scaled robotst that we test under the same conditions that we studied the animals.  The animal behavior becomes the yardstick for evaluating the validity of any given theory.  Thus, under one roof we combine computational neuroscience, animal behavior and robotics.  We focus these methods on cognitive information processing in the ""simple"" nervous systems of invertebrates.  Spatial memory, navigation and orientation using olfactory, visual and tactile sensory guidance information are areas of focus.  The relative roles of instinctive ( or ""hard-wired"" ) versus plastic ( or ""learned"" ) processes in the self organization of developing behavioral systems is central to our approach.  Species studied and modeled include cephalopods (octopuses and cuttlefishes) and crustaceans ( lobsters, crabs and crayfishes).  Use of invertebrates and our BioMimetic approach contribute to understanding the evolution of behavior by making clear the neuro-computational innovations in species on evolutionary paths not followed by vertebrates. The cross-species differences and similarities of the solutions provide insight into the design of nervous systems as computational devices.

His more recent studies have focused on how sensory deprivation influences structural changes in the brain by analyzing dendritic architectures', spine densities s as well as the impact on glial cells. In parallel, Dr. Brumberg has also investigated how information is relayed in the brain between distinct functional areas.

Claudia Brumbaugh,"Assistant Professor, Psychology",,,,,,718.997.3250,claudia.brumbaugh@qc.cuny.edu,http://qcpages.qc.cuny.edu/Psychology/people/faculty/brumbaugh.html," Dr. Claudia Brumbaugh is a social-personality psychologist who primarily researches adult attachment. One area of her research is aimed at understanding the processes that lead people to experience similar thoughts and emotions across different relationships. For instance, she has used social-cognitive paradigms to determine how experiences in past relationships influence experiences in new and ongoing relationships (e.g., Brumbaugh & Fraley, 2007). Dr. Brumbaugh also uses principles from evolutionary psychology to examine how relational decisions and behaviors might be adaptive (e.g., Brumbaugh & Wood, 2012). A substantial portion of her current research centers on people’s level of self-awareness in relationship initiation processes, as well as how people portray themselves in new dating contexts as a function of their attachment style (Brumbaugh & Fraley, 2010). Finally, the diversity present at Queens College has led her to develop research projects that address the role of culture and acculturation in people’s emotional and attachment experiences.

Her research focuses on technology, fashion, and embodiment. She has lectured on topics related to gender and race, media, bodies, and work in the U.S., Canada, Australia, and Europe. Her current work takes up the issue of how wearable technology genders bodies, research through which she is affiliated with the think/do tank, Data & Society.  ​ Wissinger is the author of This Year’s Model: Fashion, Media, and the Making of Glamour (New York University Press, 2015), in which she explores what she terms ‘glamour labor’ e.g. the work to make one’s physical presence resemble one’s highly filtered and edited presence online. From a case study of fashion models, Wissinger shows how glamour labor expands beyond the confines of high fashion and becomes a work/life requirement for everyone working in developed countries in the digital age. This argument has been featured in discussions in The Guardian, The Conversation, Cyborgology, Interface, Culture Digitally, PETRIe Inventory, and The Globe and Mail. Currently, Wissinger is working on a monograph exploring the cultural clash between the worlds of fashion and technology, exposed when wearable technology genders bodies.  Wissinger is also the co-author of the edited volume, Fashioning Models: Image, Text, and Industry (Berg, 2012) with Joanne Entwistle, author of The Fashioned Body. Wissinger has also published articles on cultural, aesthetic, and affective labor, celebrity culture, and wearable technology.

Recent journal articles include “Human Development in Global Systems,” Global Studies Journal (2012); “‘It Seems Like It’s Normal, Even’: Narrative Analyses of ‘Risk’ in Early Childcare in Rio’s Favelas,” Revista Educação em Foco–UFJF (2012), with Vasconcellos and Eisenberg; “‘Trouble’ in, around, and between Narratives,” Narrative Inquiry (2011); and “The Rights of Children, the Rights of Nations: Developmental Theory and the Politics of Children’s Rights,” Journal of Social Issues (2008).  The research paradigm of Daiute and her collaborators and students involves studying human development in the context of innovative activities in educational and community organizations in situations of political violence, conflict, postwar transitions, migration, poverty, cultural diversity, and integration. Daiute’s research also investigates critical and developmental uses of such cultural tools as literacy, narrative, social media, and community organizations for the mutual influences of young people and society. One current research project focuses on the role of teachers as agents of social integration among Roma communities in the Western Balkans, and another project studies community colleges as mediators of the deferred action policy for young immigrants to the United States.

Lev Manovich,"Professor, Computer Science",,,Computer Science,,,212-817-8190,lmanovich@gc.cuny.edu,http://www.manovich.net,"Lev Manovich, a world-renowned innovator in digital humanities and theorist of digital culture and media art, joined the Graduate Center’s doctoral faculty in January 2013 to lead digital humanities research. Manovich’s global reputation in digital humanities stems from the tremendous impact of his 2001 book, The Language of New Media, which has been translated into eight languages. One reviewer, William Warner of University of California–Santa Barbara, called the book “the most suggestive and broad ranging media history since Marshall McLuhan.” His next book, Software Takes Command, is forthcoming with Bloomsbury Publishing (July 2013).   Manovich’s innovative leadership in digital humanities is also playing a key role in the development of a new field of software studies—the study of how software shapes contemporary societies. In 2007, he founded the Software Studies Initiative (SSI) at UC–San Diego’s California Institute for Telecommunications and Information Technology (Calit2). Manovich’s research, which is housed at the Graduate Center, focuses on cultural analytics using computational and visualization techniques to analyze massive cultural data sets and flows. The techniques developed in his lab can be used in digital humanities, art history, cinema studies, game studies, media studies, ethnography, exhibition design, and other fields.   Manovich holds a Ph.D. in visual and cultural studies from the University of Rochester. His awards include a Guggenheim Fellowship; a Digital Cultures Fellowship from UC–Santa Barbara; a fellowship from the Zentrum für Literaturforschung, Berlin; and a Mellon Fellowship from California Institute for the Arts.

Frances Fox Piven,"Distinguished Professor, Political Science",,,Political Science,,,212-817-8674,fpiven@hotmail.com,,"Frances Fox Piven holds an M.A. and a Ph.D. from the University of Chicago and has been on the Graduate Center faculty since 1982. An expert in the development of the welfare state, political movements, urban politics, voting, and electoral politics, she has been politically engaged with improving the lives of America’s poor since the 1960s. She has taught at several universities in the United States and Europe and among her many books are the bestselling Poor People’s Movements (1977), one of four books she coauthored with Richard A. Cloward; Mean Season: The Attack on the Welfare State (1987); Why Americans Don’t Vote (1989); Why Americans Still Don’t Vote: And Why Politicians Want It That Way (2000); Challenging Authority: How Ordinary People Change America (2008), with Joshua Cohen; and The Lean Years (2010) and The Turbulent Years (2010), both with Irving Bernstein.   In 2011, in the face of vicious life-threatening attacks and a hate campaign spearheaded by Glenn Beck and others on the right, the New Press published Piven’s Who’s Afraid of Frances Fox Piven? The Essential Writings of the Professor Glenn Beck Loves to Hate, which clarified the trajectory of her thinking over fifty years and her lifelong commitment to political democracy, reasoned debate, and social justice. Piven has also been concerned with the impact of globalization on Left political parties, and in 1992 edited Labor Parties in Postindustrial Societies, a collection of essays on the subject.   A recipient of numerous academic and public awards for her work, she was president of the American Sociological Association in 2007, has served on the boards of the American Civil Liberties Union and the Democratic Socialists of America, was founding board chair of the New Press, and is currently a Left Forum board member.
