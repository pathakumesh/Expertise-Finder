Jonathan Carp,Adjunct,School of Public Health,Biomedical Sciences,(518) 486-491,jonathan.carp@health.ny.gov,"Studies neural control of lower urinary tract, expert in neural injury and repair","The primary interest of professor Carp’s laboratory is the identification of the harmful plasticity that occurs after SCI that leads to urinary dysfunction, and the development of methods for counteracting or reversing this harmful plasticity to improve urinary function. An example of this harmful plasticity is what happens to the nerve cells that control the external urethral sphincter (EUS) muscle. This muscle serves as a valve that allows or blocks the expulsion of urine from the bladder. When these EUS nerve cells (called motoneurons) lose their normal inputs after SCI, they have the ability to increase their own intrinsic level of excitability, apparently in an attempt to recover their normal function. If their excitability increases too much, they do not turn off to allow urine to flow when the bladder is full. This often results in urinary retention and chronic infections. There are two projects currently ongoing in this laboratory. The first project is to determine if EUS motoneuron over-excitability can be reduced pharmacologically to allow more normal control of urination after SCI using drugs that interact with two brain chemicals—serotonin and norepinephrine—that are normally released onto these EUS motoneurons by neural pathways that descend from the brain. These pathways are often interrupted by SCI. We believe that the loss of these pathways causes EUS motoneurons to increase their excitability (like automatic gain control on a radio when the incoming signal becomes weak), and that this increase produces urinary retention. A class of drugs called inverse agonists have the ability to prevent this increase in excitability, even when the normal brain pathways are not working. The second project involves enhancing the pathways from the brain that are compromised after incomplete SCI that control the EUS motoneurons in the spinal cord. The goal of this project is to use operant conditioning techniques developed at the Wadsworth Center to induce beneficial plasticity to improve the efficacy of the brain’s control over the EUS motoneurons after SCI. This approach could also be useful for treatment of the urinary dysfunction that frequently occurs after traumatic brain injury or neurodegenerative disease.",https://www.albany.edu/news/experts/carp_jonathan.jpg,https://www.albany.edu/news/experts/73945.php,Identifies the harmful plasticity that occurs after spinal cord injury leads to urinary dysfunction,and the development of methods for counteracting or reversing this harmful plasticity to improve urinary function.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The work will be a critical step forward in predicting future climate patterns on Earth. The research, supported by a $500,000 grant from NASA Earth Science, investigates aerosol-radiation-chemistry-climate, an interactive system currently not well understood. The research group has already developed a state-of-the-art advanced particle microphysics (APM) model that enables one to predict key aerosol properties (size, composition, mixing state, etc.) important for their environmental and climatic impacts. How aerosol particle sizes affect UV actinic fluxes, tropospheric oxidation capacity, and heterogeneous chemistry is of great interest to the strategic research objectives of NASA’s Atmospheric Chemistry Modeling and Analysis Program, whose previous funding support aided Yu’s development of the APM model. Actinic flux deals with the quantity of light available to molecules at a particular point in the atmosphere and which, on absorption, drives photochemical processes in the atmosphere. Tropospheric oxidation capacity is an important indicator of the cleansing capacity of the atmosphere, including the relative lifetime of important greenhouse gases.

A native of York, England, Temple leads a team of 30 researchers focused on using neural stem cells to develop therapies for eye, brain and spinal cord disorders. In 2008, she was awarded the MacArthur Fellowship Award for her contribution and future potential in the neural stem cell field. Temple received her undergraduate degree at Cambridge University, Cambridge U.K., specializing in developmental biology and neuroscience. She continued her Ph.D. work at University College London, U.K. and postdoctoral fellowship at Columbia University, N.Y., where she focused on optic nerve development. In 1989, Temple discovered that the embryonic mammalian brain contained a rare stem-like cell. Since then she has continued to make pioneering contributions to the field of stem cell research, focusing on the question of how neural stem cells alter their developmental potential over time to generate diverse progeny.  Her research indicates that internal counting mechanisms, rather than external signals in the progenitors, determine the number of cell divisions they undergo.  She has identified markers on progenitor cell lines and external signaling molecules that participate in maintaining and differentiating them. Temple’s studies suggest that the limited success to date of embryonic stem cell transplants to repair neural damage could be due to introduction of stem cells at the wrong stage of development. It may be that progenitor cells further along in their differentiation will prove more effective. Through her research on the differentiation of neural progenitors, Temple brings us closer to developing effective clinical treatments for central nervous system damage due to trauma, neurodegenerative diseases, malignancy, or stroke. As scientific director of NSCI, Temple oversees the research mission from basic to translational projects. She is also responsible for the staff, the budget and for developing the overall strategic plan for the institute.

The Newborn Screening Program at Wadsworth Center tests for over 40 genetic disorders in newborns. Infants who have one of several rare genetic disorders and infants who have been exposed to HIV are identified promptly; with medical treatment serious disease can often be prevented. One of the tests is molecular detection of cystic fibrosis (CF) by screening for a mutation panel in the CFTR gene. Certain mutations in this gene cause severe phenotype and are well-defined. The gold standard for a CF diagnosis is a sweat chloride test. Screening has uncovered individuals whose sweat chloride values are above normal, but no other CF symptoms are identified. The program's aim is to determine if other variants in the CFTR gene correlate with these abnormal sweat chloride levels. This will be carried out by searching for other variants in the CFTR gene and also modifier genes (other genes that may modulate sweat chloride values). A different newborn screening test that is provided detects Krabbe disease, which is caused by the deficient activity of galactosylceramidase (GALC gene). Expression studies to determine the enzyme activity resulting from mutations in the GALC gene compared to activities present when the normal gene is expressed will be performed in order to better understand and perhaps predict the clinical presentation, evolution and prognosis of the disease.",https://www.albany.edu/news/experts/tavakoli_norma.jpg,https://www.albany.edu/news/experts/74236.php,Newborn screening,genetic disorders,molecular detection techniques,cystic fibrosis,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Pata and her research team are particularly interested in how the replicative polymerases, which are responsible for the majority of genome duplication, are replaced by the more specialized polymerases that are responsible for translesion synthesis across from damaged DNA bases.

His work examines the ways Europeans and Native Americans interacted with contested spaces — those that defied ownership and jurisdiction, that were neither ""natural"" nor ""civilized""— which has steered my research into a decidedly watery world. His book, Between Land and Sea: The Atlantic Coast and the Transformation of New England, examines the environmental history of Narragansett Bay (Rhode Island) from first European settlement in 1636 through industrialization during the first half of the nineteenth century. This study uses one of the largest estuaries on the East Coast and one situated at the heart of early English settlement in New England as a means to write estuaries into Atlantic history. Pastore's work recovers that history by examining the ways settlers drew resources from rivers and creeks and the bays into which they flowed. He explores the ways coasts were mapped by explorers, promoters, and professional cartographers and how those processes reflected cultural conceptions of water through time.

The goal of this research is to provide better insights into what is now called the “exposome."" The exposome can be defined as “the measure of all the exposures of an individual in a lifetime and how those exposures relate to health,” according to the Center for Disease Control and Prevention. Each person has a unique exposome, which begins before birth, and continues throughout life with exposures from the environment, diet, lifestyle, etc., interacting with our own unique genetics and physiology. Understanding how trace elements may impact the exposome is important – from the nutritional role of the essential elements, e.g., Cu, Se and Zn, to assessing exposure to non-essential toxic elements such as Pb, Cd, Hg and As. Parsons, who grew up in England, joined the New York State Department of Health’s (NYS DOH) Wadsworth Center in 1986 as Director of the state’s Lead Poisoning Laboratory. Under the MOU between the University and the NYS DOH, he received a joint appointment as an Assistant Professor in the Department of Environmental Health Sciences, and was later promoted to Professor in 2007. He served as the Department Chair from 2011 to 2017 Parsons’ laboratory has developed specialized techniques for measuring trace elements at extremely low levels in human tissues and body fluids, as well as in food and environmental matrices, using state-of-the-art analytical techniques based on atomic spectrometry. The laboratory has developed new methods for human biomonitoring based on inorganic mass spectrometry. Trace element analysis at the µg/L to ng/L range is carried by inductively coupled plasma-mass spectrometry (ICP-MS).  The Parsons’ lab is well equipped with 3 triple quads, a sector field ICP-MS, and 6 single quad ICP-MS, three portable XRF instruments, and three class 100 clean rooms. Ongoing collaborations are supported by NIEHS and CDC funding. Parsons has published more than 160 papers in his field of expertise and has served on national panels related to childhood lead poisoning. He received his Ph.D. in inorganic biochemistry from the University of London, England, and completed postdoctoral studies at the National Institutes of Health in Maryland. At Wadsworth, Parsons is current Director of the Division of Environmental Health Sciences, and Chief, Laboratory of Inorganic and Nuclear Chemistry.",https://www.albany.edu/news/experts/patrickparsons(1).jpg,https://www.albany.edu/news/experts/83718.php,Childhood lead poisoning,atomic spectrometry,trace element analysis,inorganic mass spectrometry,human biomonitoring and environmental measurements of toxic metals.,,,,,,,,,,,,

        Supported by a three-year, $225,000 Liver Scholars Award from the American Association for the Study of Liver Diseases, Pager is investigating the process in which HCV exploits liver cells and manipulates a host protein called RCK to build new viruses. HCV is a widespread risk factor for developing liver cancer, the most common cause of cancer-related deaths. No viable vaccine exists for the world’s 200 million HCV-infected individuals, and they are left with largely inadequate treatments.
        Research shows that HCV prompts the RCK protein to first help the virus bind tiny liver-specific RNA molecules and, second, to build new virus particles. Pager hopes her research will lead to new breakthrough drug therapies that will block RCK from building new virus particles.

As a research scientist at the Wadsworth Center of the N.Y. State Department of Health (directing the Molecular Genetics Program, and the Laboratory of Human Genetics), she has published over 100 papers on genetics, mechanisms, and therapeutics for neurodevelopmental and neurodegenerative diseases, including papers in Nature, Nature Genetics, Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, Molecular Therapy, and major neuroscience journals. She has been funded by multiple NIH grants and several disease foundations, while reviewing grants for over 25 NIH study sections, and 12 national and international funding agencies. In the late 1990s, she pioneered the use of engineered antibody fragments (nanobodies and intrabodies) to counteract the cellular effects of misfolding proteins in stressed and aging cells. Since then, she has amassed a body of publications applying this technology to Huntington’s and Parkinson’s disease, ranging from antibody engineering and nanobody selection to in vivo delivery by novel gene therapies. There are many commonalities between the neurodegenerative diseases that have been her primary focus and the breakdown of cellular function in Age-related Macular Degeneration. Therefore, she recently moved her most relevant technology and extensive expertise to NSCI, to bring this powerful approach to the exciting stem cell work being done by her long-term colleagues, Drs. Sally Temple and Jeff Stern. Messer received her PhD in Molecular Biology from the Univ. Oregon Institute of Molecular Biology, studying the genetics of membrane permeation in E. coli.",https://www.albany.edu/news/experts/messer-1.jpg,https://www.albany.edu/news/experts/74209.php,Neurodegenerative disorders (Huntington's Disease,Parkinson's Disease),stem cells,human genetics,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Another major line of research examines the role of insulin, not only active in modulation of brain functions beyond control of food intake, but as a critical component of hippocampal memory and metabolic processes. McNay explores how memory improved by administration of insulin, as well as how inhibition of insulin signalling within the hippocampus entirely wipes out spatial memory processing. Other ongoing research areas include the relationship between insulin and beta-amyloid, in both diabetes (especially type 2 diabetes) and Alzheimer's disease; the interactions between the brain's multiple memory systems; and the impact of fatty acids and a high-fat diet on cognitive and neural functions.

To address these issues, we investigate a wide range of scales from the assessment of reactive oxygen species (ROS) activity of fine particulate matter (PM2.5), to observations in outdoor and indoor environments, to studies of the effects of short-term exposure of PM2.5 on daily morbidity and mortality due to cardiovascular and pulmonary diseases among adults and young children residing in various communities of large cities. •	Acid Rain: Careful monitoring of precipitation chemistry is essential to fully understand the threat of anthropogenic pollution to such susceptible areas as NYS. This project focuses on identification of pollution sources in atmospheric precipitation for episodic high concentration of inorganic and organic pollutants, and trace metals using multivariate analysis. •	Tracking environmental contaminants and microorganisms in New York State (NYS) schools: In collaboration with Dr. Shao Lin (University at Albany) and Dr. Kerry Kinney (University of Texas, Austin), environmental pollutants (PM, CO2, CO, formaldehyde, and volatile organic compounds (VOC)) are being monitored in classrooms at 10 randomly selected NYS schools. The aim of this project is to examine the relationship between school’s environment and occupant health, learning, and performance in NYS schools, and to promote the best school practice. •	Sources & fate of chemical contaminants: We study sources, transport, and sink of environmental pollutants including inorganic and organic species. This is carried out by state-of-the-art techniques for chemical analysis, laboratory experimentation, and field sampling. •	Water and human health issues: To evaluate drinking water quality and human health risks associated with water contaminants, we conduct monitoring studies and develop new methods for chemical analysis (e.g., hexavalent chromium, perchlorate).",https://www.albany.edu/news/experts/Haider.Khwaja.jpg,https://www.albany.edu/news/experts/54591.php,acid rain,cloud water chemistry,water and human health issues,health impacts of air pollution,,,,,,,,,,,,,

While virtually eradicated in the United States, Tuberculosis occupies the top spot as the world’s number one infectious killer. A combination of improved living conditions and the use of antibiotics have reduced the domestic incidence of tuberculosis so effectively that it has nearly vanished from the U.S. But this situation is tenuous. Americans are often shocked to hear that one-third of global population is infected with Mycobacterium tuberculosis. The ease of international travel assures our continued exposure to this infectious agent. Several complicating factors reduce the efficacy the antibiotic regimens used to treat tuberculosis, ultimately promoting drug resistance. The emergence of escalating levels of antibiotic resistant strains of M. tuberculosis pose major public health threats wherever they are found. Gray and his team at the Wadsworth Center are utilizing novel techniques to better understand M. tuberculosis, and learn how to control its growth and pathogenicity. His lab combines multiple genome-wide tools, such as whole-genome sequencing, expression arrays, and ChIP-chip assays to identify key processes and interactions that may be exploited as therapeutic targets. Since many of the M. tuberculosis genes, proteins, and biological pathways are conserved in other mycobacteria, he uses the fast-growing, non-pathogenic Mycobacterium smegmatis for most of his studies. His team's goal is to further leverage their experimental system to expedite the development of the much-needed next generation of tuberculosis vaccines or therapeutics.",https://www.albany.edu/news/experts/gray_todd.jpg,https://www.albany.edu/news/experts/74407.php,Molecular genetics of mycobacteria,infectious diseases,Tuberculosis,human genome,gene therapeutics,,,,,,,,,,,,

He has done extensive research on the application of satellite remote sensing in the areas of soil moisture and terrestrial evapotranspiration, land-atmosphere interactions, and the global hydrological response to climate change, among other climate-relevant topics. Improved weather and climate forecasting at longer lead times allows additional time for coping and adaptation to severe weather and climate change, respectively. A key source of inter-model disagreement historically has been the strength of the land surface’s role in weather and climate predictability. Ferguson, however, pioneered research using microwave and infrared sensors on NASA’s Aqua Earth Observing System satellite that, for the first time ever, resolved which models tended to correctly represent regional land-atmospheric coupling and feedbacks. This work has paved the way for comparison, evaluation and refinement of models.

He is a member of the ATLAS collaboration, working on trigger algorithms, muon reconstruction, and supersymmetry studies. Data collected by the ATLAS detector at the Large Hadron Collider at CERN, Switzerland, is used to study the fundamental properties of the universe, its constituents — such as electrons and quarks — as well as interactions between them, such as electromagnetic and nuclear forces. Experiments at CERN led to the discovery of the Higgs boson in July 2012, the particle crucial for the confirmation of the Standard Model of particle physics, formulated since 1964 to explain the observed particles and forces in nature.  Although the Standard Model has had spectacular success in explaining past observations, it is incomplete. The expectation is that new physics is just around the corner. The UAlbany group, led by Ernst and Assistant Professor Vivek Jain and supported by U.S. Department of Energy grants, has been working on the Higgs as well as supersymmetry, a theory which posits that there are partners to all known fundamental particles.  In such theories, up to five Higgs bosons can exist. The ATLAS experiment, which generates petabytes of data, uses a worldwide grid of computers to conduct the data analysis on this large dataset. Ernst's previous work involved studies of B meson decays.

Marcus Adams,Assistant Professor ,College of Arts and Sciences,Philosophy,(518) 442-426,madams2@albany.edu,"Expert in history and philosophy of the 16th and 17th centuries, and ethical issues related to medical triage, organ transplantation and informed consent.","Assistant Professor Marcus Adams specializes in the History and Philosophy of Science. His primary area of research concerns the impact of figures in the Scientific Revolution, such as Galileo Galilei and Robert Boyle, upon the Philosophy and Politics of 17th Century England. Most of his research has focused up the work of the English Philosopher Thomas Hobbes, a figure often viewed as the first modern political theorist. The issues that Adams’s research addresses in their historical and philosophical contexts, such as Thomas Hobbes’s attempt to construct a science of politics that would possess the same level of certainty in its demonstrations as geometry, relate to questions of continual importance in contemporary Philosophy and Politics. Adams also has research interests in contemporary issues in Applied Ethics. He has written articles and chapters on the nature of physician obligations with particular focus on the roles of military physicians and organ transplant physicians. Adams received his Ph.D. in History and Philosophy of Science from the University of Pittsburgh.",https://www.albany.edu/news/experts/adams1(1).jpg,https://www.albany.edu/news/experts/82989.php,History,philosophy,politics of 17th century England,the Scientific Revolution,ethics in medical triage,organ transplantation and informed consent.,,,,,,,,,,,
