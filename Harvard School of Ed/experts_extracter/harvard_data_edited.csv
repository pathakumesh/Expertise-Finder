He has  twice been selected by  and  magazines as  one of 100 most influential public intellectuals in the world. In 2011, Gardner  received the Prince of Asturias Award for Social Sciences, and in 2015, he was  chosen as the recipient of the Brock International Prize in Education. He has  been elected a member of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences, the  American Philosophical Society, the National Academy of Education, and the  London-based Royal Society for the Encouragement of Arts, Manufactures, and  Commerce. He serves on a number of boards, including New York's Museum of  Modern Art and the American Philosophical Society.The author of thirty books  translated into thirty-two languages, and several hundred articles, Gardner is  best known in educational circles for his theory of multiple intelligences, a  critique of the notion that there exists but a single human intelligence that  can be assessed by standard psychometric instruments (please see  ). Since the middle 1990s, Gardner has directed  , a group of initiatives, founded in collaboration with  psychologists Mihaly Csikszentmihalyi and William Damon, that promotes  excellence, engagement, and ethics in education, preparing students to become  good workers and good citizens who contribute to the overall well-being of  society. Through research-based concepts, frameworks, and resources, the  Project seeks to help students reflect upon the  ethical dilemmas that arise in everyday life and give them the tools to make thoughtful decisions.His newest research undertaking is  a large-scale national study documenting how different groups think about the  goals of college and the value of a course of study emphasizing liberal arts  and sciences. The study seeks to understand how the chief constituencies on campuses (incoming  students, graduating students, faculty, senior administrators, parents,  alumni/ae, trustees and job recruiters) think about these changes and how they  may impact the college experience in our time. Ultimately, the study aims to  provide valuable suggestions of how best to provide quality, non-professional  higher education in the 21st century.",https://www.gse.harvard.edu/sites/default/files/faculty/images/howard-gardner-316.jpg,http://www.howardgardner.com,https://www.gse.harvard.edu/faculty/howard-gardner,Arts in Education,Child Development,Cognitive Development,Early Childhood Development,Higher Education Administration,Higher Education Curriculum,Intelligence,Interdisciplinary Education,Leadership,Moral and Ethical Studies,Psychology,,,,,,,
