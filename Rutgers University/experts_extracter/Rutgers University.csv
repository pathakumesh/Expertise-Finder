Guy Werlen,Associate Professor,Department of Cell Biology and Neuroscience,School of Arts and Sciences,New Brunswick Campus,,"Guy Werlen has a long-standing interest in understanding how the distinct cells of the immune system provide protection against any invading pathogen. His current research work is focusing on T lymphocytes, a key regulatory cell of the immune system. Their absence or malfunction has dramatic consequences such as immunodeficiency syndromes (AIDS), autoimmune diseases (multiple sclerosis), cancer, as well as chronic allergies or asthma. Understanding the development and function of those cells will bring about new means for therapeutic treatments.Werlen strongly believes that educating people about the fundamentals of the immune system (what it is composed of, how it works, etc.) will be a tremendous benefit to society. Explaining how prophylactic vaccination programs helps  boosting one's immune system could, for example, not only benefit each individual's health but also avoid the spreading of  epidemic diseases and, as a consequence, lower the costs of health care.

He is currently surveying the kinematics, mass distributions, and stellar contents of the dense centers of globular star clusters, the oldest clusters in our Galaxy.With the Rutgers Imaging Fabry-Perot Spectrometer in Chile, he has been able to increase the number of stellar radial velocities in these regions by an order of magnitude, thus providing a clearer picture of some of the most extreme stellar environments known.Another way to study the kinematics of globular clusters is using proper motions for individual stars measured with images taken by the Hubble Space Telescope. One use for such data is searching for a massive black hole near the center of a cluster. Pryor is a member of a group with such data for several clusters.He is also studying the amount and spatial distribution of dark matter in the dwarf spheroidal companions of our Galaxy in an attempt to determine what the dark matter is.Currently Pryor is using the Hubble Space Telescope imaging to measure the systemic proper motions of the Carina, Draco, Fornax, Sculptor, Sextans, and Ursa Minor dwarf spheroidal galaxies. These motions yield the space velocity of each galaxy and, hence, its orbit around the Milky Way.Goals are to use this information to determine if the dwarf spheroidals move together in coherent streams in the halo of our Galaxy and to constrain the importance of the Galactic tidal force in determining the structure and star-formation history of the dwarf spheroidals. He also use the motions of the dwarf spheroidals to constrain the mass of the Milky Way.",pryor@physics.rutgers.edu,732-445-5462,,http://ucmweb.rutgers.edu/experts/index.php?a=display&f=expert&id=1126,http://ucmweb.rutgers.edu/speakers/images/speakerimages/1126.jpg,http://www.physics.rutgers.edu/~pryor/,Structure and evolution of star clusters and galaxies,globular star clusters,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Plant viruses are investigated with the ultimate goal of their control. Primary emphasis for control is by use of transgenic, virus-resistant plants bearing viral sequences.

This is achieved through characterization, genetic manipulation and reintroduction of cDNA copies of these viruses into their original fungal hosts or other plant pathogenic fungi.

One practical application of this is found in shopping online: the systems that supposedly make online shopping secure rely on unproven complexity-theoretic assumptions. In fact, proving (or disproving) these assumptions form some of the most important unsolved questions in mathematics and computer science.  Instead of searching for clever programs to solve problems, a complexity theoretician tries to prove that there is no clever program.Over the decades, this theory has been intimately connected to other fundamental questions such as: What is randomness?
