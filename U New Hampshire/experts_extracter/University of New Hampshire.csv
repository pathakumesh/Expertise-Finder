She is specifically interested in understanding the influence of various contextual factors (e.g., marital conflict, family stressors, job strain, culture) on the quality of parenting and parental well-being; and the subsequent impact of these factors on the quality of parent-child relationship processes and children’s social-emotional outcomes.
She received her bachelor of science degree in psychology and child development and her master’s degree in human development and family studies at Central Michigan University. She earned her Ph.D. in human development and family studies at Purdue University in 2014.

Timm Triplett,Associate Professor of Philosophy,"Dr. Triplett joined UNH in 1980. His areas of expertise include ethics; teaching philosophy to students in elementary, middle and high schools; and ethics and civic engagement.
He is currently working on a book titled Ethics for Everyone. He argues that, contrary to common perceptions, ethics is a universal and objective system that applies to all people and all cultures. This universality offers an optimistic take on ways we can better understand and address the social disagreements and partisan battles that seem to stymie social progress. While these conflicts are real, he says, it is surprising how little, on analysis, they have to do with ethics. This suggests that the disagreements we do have do not go as deep as they appear. We can find our common humanity in the common morality we all share.
Dr. Triplett can also speak to the media on the topics of avoiding biased thinking and  color perception.",College of Liberal Arts,,timm.triplett@unh.edu,862-3073,,https://www.unh.edu/unhtoday/expert/triplett-timm,https://www.unh.edu/unhtoday/sites/default/files/styles/expert__600x400_/public/expert/triplett.jpg?itok=gS298H4F,http://cola.unh.edu/philosophy,Ethics,Biased thinking,Color perception,,,,,,,,

John D. Mayer,Professor of Psychology,"Dr. Mayer is an expert in personality psychology and measurement. One of his specialties focuses on how people understand one another. In particular, he studies emotional intelligence, which concerns the ability to understand one’s own and others emotions; and personal intelligence, which concerns the ability to understand personality in oneself and others. (He is the author of the book, Personal intelligence: The power of personality and how it shapes our lives, published by Scientific American/Farrar, Straus & Giroux).
HIs specialty focuses on psychological test development and validation. He can speak to the media about how psychological tests work and the standards they need to meet to be regarded as measuring what they claim to. Finally, as part of his broader interests in personality psychology, his theoretical work concerns the everyday question of why and how people evaluate one another's personalities, as well as the more formal question of what the field of personality psychology studies (or ought to study).

Michael Goldberg,Professor of Economics ,"Michael D. Goldberg is the Todd H. Crockett Professor of Economics at the University of New Hampshire and a senior research associate at the Institute for New Economic
Thinking (INET). He has written extensively in the fields of International Finance and Macroeconomics and his columns on asset price fluctuations and policy reform have been
published by leading newspapers in more than 50 countries. 
His bestselling books, Imperfect Knowledge Economics: Exchange Rates and Risk (Princeton University Press, 2007) and Beyond Mechanical Markets: Asset Price Swings, Risk, and the Role of the State (Princeton University Press, 2011), both co-authored with Roman Frydman, propose a new approach to macroeconomic modeling that recognizes that the structure of the economy changes at times and in ways that do conform to a probabilistic rule. Beyond Mechanical Markets was a finalist for the 2011 TIAA-CREF Paul A. Samuelson Award. The book was also one of the Financial Times non-fiction favorites of 2011, commended by its chief economics commentator, Martin Wolf. James Pressley of Bloomberg News also selected it as a top business book of 2011. 
Michael Goldberg's expertise is in macroeconomics, financial markets, and monetary policy. He argues that the longstanding empirical failures of conventional economic models stem from their futile efforts to make exact predictions about the consequences of rational, self-interested behavior.
