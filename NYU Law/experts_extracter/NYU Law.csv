George H. Sorter,University Professor Emeritus,Vincent C. Ross Professor of Accounting Emeritus,,,212.998.6157,gsorter@stern.nyu.edu,"George Sorter has built a career as a leading theorist and innovator in the world of accounting. He formulated the “events theory,” which describes accounting as a form of history chronicling the important events of a unit. Like all history, its purpose is to understand the past in order to plan for the future. How this planning can best be accomplished has been the subject of Sorter’s research and teaching for the past 40 years. Since he joined the faculty of NYU School of Law in 1990, he has focused on the limitations and uses of accounting data for legal issues such as contracts, damages, and valuation. He teaches Accounting for Lawyers. The American Accounting Association has honored Sorter with the Outstanding Educator Award, despite terming him the “iconoclast” of the profession.
