Josh Aronson,Associate Professor of Applied Psychology,(212) 998-5543,joshua.aronson@nyu.edu,Applied Psychology,,"Most of my work seeks to understand and remediate gaps in learning, standardized test performance, and well being among culturally disadvantaged students. Often, the low performance of students of color and low socioeconomic status gets casually chalked up to genetic or cultural differences that supposedly block acquisition of skills or values necessary for academic success. In contrast, my students, colleagues, and I have uncovered some exciting and encouraging answers to these old questions by looking at the psychology of stigma - the way human beings respond to social threats and the fragility of human performance, motivation and curiosity. We have found that being targeted by well-known cultural stereotypes (""blacks are unintelligent"", ""girls can't do math"", and so on) can be threatening, a predicament my mentor and I called ""Stereotype Threat."" Stereotype threat (AKA identity threat) engenders a number of interesting psychological and physiological responses, many of which interfere with intellectual performance and academic motivation. My lab has conducted numerous studies showing how stereotype threat depresses the standardized test performance of black, Latino, and female college students. These same studies showed how changing the testing situation (even subtly) to reduce stereotype threat, can improve standardized test scores. This work offers a more optimistic view of race and gender gaps than the older theories that focused on poverty, culture, or genetic factors. We have found that we can do a lot to boost both achievement and the enjoyment of school by understanding and attending to these psychological processes, thereby unseating the power of stereotypes and prejudice to foil the academic aspirations of the young people who are subjected to circumstances that compromise their growth. A particular focus of my recent work is on creating scalable interventions that  schools can use to improve the performance and learning of their students. These interventions include my work on growth mindsets, meditation, and mindfulness, but also  broader interventions that change school culture and student character development with what I call ""four-dimensional curriculum.""",https://steinhardt.nyu.edu/scmsAdmin/uploads/003/448/220-Aronson_bio.jpg,https://steinhardt.nyu.edu/faculty/Joshua_Aronson,"Urban education",Discrimination,"Testing (standardized testing, intelligence testing)","Race, ethnicity, and education",Achievement gap,Effects of Meditation and Mindfulness on Teacher Effectiveness and Intellectual Growth,,,,,,,

His primary interest concerns the development of cognitive abilities referred to as executive functions and the ways in which these aspects of cognition are important for school readiness and early school achievement. He is also interested in the development and evaluation of preschool and elementary school curricula designed to promote executive functions as a means of preventing school failure. In 2002, Blair and his colleagues at Penn State University and at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill received funding from the National Institute of Child Health and Human Development for a longitudinal, population-based study of family ecology and child development beginning at birth. In his part of the project, Blair is examining interaction between early experiential and biological influences on the development of executive functions and related aspects of self-regulation. Ultimately, Blair and his colleagues plan to follow this sample through the school years and into young adulthood. Prior to coming to NYU, Blair spent ten years as an assistant and then associate professor in the department of Human Development and Family Studies at Penn State.

Her research aims to explain how children’s articulatory and perceptual limitations shape their early phonological development, and why some children's speech sound errors do not resolve over the course of maturation or in response to conventional forms of treatment. She has an active program of clinical research investigating the efficacy of intervention that uses technologies (e.g. ultrasound, acoustic analysis) to provide visual biofeedback for persistent speech sound errors in children. She also leads an interdisciplinary team that is developing an app (staRt, ""Speech Therapist's App for /r/ Treatment"") to make visual-acoustic biofeedback widely available to practicing speech-language pathologists. McAllister has published in journals such as Phonology, the Journal of Speech, Language, and Hearing Research, the Journal of Communication Disorders, and the Journal of Child Language. Her research on technologically advanced interventions for speech sound disorders is supported by the National Institute on Deafness and Other Communication Disorders (R03DC012883; R01DC013668).

Joseph McDonald,"Professor Emeritus, Teaching and Learning",212 995 8220,joseph.mcdonald@nyu.edu,,,"Joseph McDonald continues a life-long pursuit of reform in educational contexts. It started in the second grade when he got into trouble for thinking that children should be able to walk around more in the classroom. In high school, it led him to think at first that he could learn more at home than in school, though he soon found friends who were willing to use the margins of school to teach each other more than their classes were teaching. In college, he was a successful write-in candidate for student body president, and as a teacher, he was drawn to unconventional schools, eventually becoming lead teacher at a public alternative high school, and later the founder of an interdisciplinary high school program where math mixed with science, history with art and literature, and PE with rock climbing and drama. School reform shaped his dissertation at Harvard, then drew him to the Brown University teacher education program and the Coalition of Essential Schools. It also shaped his work as Director of Research at Brown's Annenberg Institute, and later inspired his most important work as Steinhardt's Academic Dean - namely designing and launching NYU's Partnership Schools Network. More recently, McDonald's pursuit of educational reform has guided his work with Steinhardt's residency-based teacher education program, his work as a trustee of the Great Oaks Charter School of New York City, and his effort to help bring improvement science to teacher education. Meanwhile, it has long shaped his work as a writer.  McDonald is the author or co-author of ten books about teaching and schooling. The latest is Data and Teaching: Moving beyond Magical Thinking to Effective Practice. It is based on a Spencer Foundation-funded study of nine poverty-impacted schools in New York City, and will be published by Teachers College Press in mid-2018. Other books include the best-selling Power of Protocols, now in its third edition, Going Online with Protocols (both published by Teachers College Press), and American School Reform: What Works, What Fails, and Why (University of Chicago Press), winner of a 2015 PROSE Award from the Association of American Publishers.

In particular, my research seeks to understand how political authority changes when multicultural societies with recently nationalized state apparatuses simultaneously experience the growth of communications, rising consumption, market deregulation, and a diminishing monopoly over the legitimate means of coercion. I ask how print and electronic media together enable the rise of more democratic public cultures and social relations, even as they are also crucial to the rise of new disciplinary technologies. In the process, I highlight the drawbacks of Eurocentric accounts of media and technology that relegate non-western developments to the status of marginalia and aberration.,,,,

Brett Gary,"Associate Professor of Media, Culture and Communication",212 998 5113,brett.gary@nyu.edu,"Media, Culture, and Communication",,"Brett Gary became fascinated by propaganda and the control of information when he was just out of college and working for a United States senator. “I was assigned the task of responding to letters from the senator’s outraged constituents. In doing so, I realized that the senate stationery afforded me the power to appease constituents. I was essentially the staff propagandist!” He was also coming of age during the Reagan administration. “Brilliant propaganda spectacles were shaping the national discourse. Anyone not interested in propaganda and how it functioned at that time wasn’t paying attention.” After he received his Ph.D. in American studies from the University of Pennsylvania, Gary wrote his first book, The Nervous Liberals. The book looks at anxieties about propaganda between World War I and the Cold War. “During that time, people feared that demagogues and dictators would use new media technologies like film, radio, shortwave, print, and later television to seduce the public through propaganda.” As Gary researched this period, his thoughts turned to the limits of the First Amendment, and the ideas for this next book - which he is currently in the midst of writing - began to take shape. “The new book centers on the work of Morris Ernst, the country’s foremost First Amendment authority during the middle decades of the 20th century,” says Gary. “Ernst was a fascinating person. He defended a host of important figures – including James Joyce’s publisher - in cases where literary modernism came up against the censors.” Ernst also worked with Margaret Sanger to ensure that licensed physicians were able to get information and birth control technology to their patients. “Here was a moment in American culture where literary modernism and sexual modernism are both being granted their legal legitimacy in the federal courts – and there’s one guy who’s orchestrating all this: Ernst. He wanted to win landmark cases.” Gary sees the contemplation of Ernst’s life as a way for his students to sort through mid-century American history. “Ernst’s life reflects tensions and paradoxes within the culture at a time when American liberalism and censorship were being defined. There is richness in the complexity of his story. My task as a teacher is to ground my students in the details of complicated historical processes.” He says his students are up to the task because they are “extremely sharp and sophisticated critics of culture.” In fact, one of his goals is to see more of his excellent masters students move into the PhD program. “If we could create a pipeline to our doctoral program - or other good programs around the country - we’d be performing a valuable service for our students and the intellectual community at large.” After teaching modern history and literature at Drew University for several years, Gary joined the Department of Media, Culture, and Communication as an Associate Professor because he wanted to be a part “a dynamic and research-rich university. I also wanted to participate in a department that is moving ahead in really interesting ways. The field of media studies is exploding and the department recognizes that there is a place for historians in the field. By teaching here, I bring my approach as a historian to a conversation about media’s place in modern culture.”",https://steinhardt.nyu.edu/scmsAdmin/uploads/008/731/16-0153-2-web.jpg,https://steinhardt.nyu.edu/faculty/Brett_Gary,Censorship,"Propaganda",Censorship and the rise of anti-censorship liberalism in American society,,,,,,,,,,

Selcuk R. Sirin,Professor of Applied Psychology,(212) 998-5364,sirins@nyu.edu,Applied Psychology,,"As an applied psychologist, I use empirical research methods to better understand the needs of children and families, and to arm professionals and policy makers with this knowledge so as to better address the needs of the most vulnerable. As summarized in Figure 1, the goal, that unites all of my work, is to enhance the lives of marginalized children using development in context as a general framework. I focus on immigrant children in New York, Muslim youth in the US, refugees in Turkey and Norway, and students at risk in US schools. I have published my work in top journals, such as Child Development, Developmental Psychology, Review of Educational Research, and Pediatrics, in an effort to inform scholars, practitioners, and policy makers about marginalized children. I have also made a concerted effort to get my work to a wider audience both locally and globally, as I believe strongly in “giving scientific knowledge away.” I have served on several policy committees such as the National Academy of Sciences, the Urban Institute, and the Migration Policy Institute. I have collaborated with UNESCO and Save the Children, in their efforts to improve the lives of refugee children. Currently, I direct the following research projects in his research lab.  New York City Academic and Social Engagement Study (NYCASES) is a three-year longitudinal study of urban youth through high school. The study will identify the degree to which individual, family, and school characteristics predict the changes in educational outcomes of youth throughout their high school years, from 10th grade to 12th grade. The first wave of data were gathered in Spring 2008 semester with a cohort of 517 10th graders. This project is funded by NYU Challenge Grant and the Spencer Foundation. The Longitudinal Immigrant Families and Teachers Study (LIFTS) is a three-year examination of parent and teacher perceptions of first graders with immigrant parents. The goal of this study is to understand how parent and teacher practices and values influence their perception of children’s academic achievement and psychological well-being. The first wave of data was gathered during the Spring 2007 with a cohort of 191 first graders. This project is funded by the Foundation for Child Development. Meta-Analysis of Immigrant Paradox . Why do new immigrants tend to have more positive developmental and educational outcomes than those who are more acculturated to the United States? Dr. Sirin has designed a meta-analysis with Dr. Amy Marks (Suffolk University) to answer this much debated question immigrant paradox. Once completed in the next two years the project will not only provide the first meta-analytic review in the literature, but it will also identify critical moderators of acculturation-outcomes relations such as the role of ethnic origin (e.g., Asian vs. Latino), developmental phase (e.g., early childhood, middle childhood, adolescence and young adulthood), and research methodology (e.g., the type of acculturation measure and outcome measures). This project is funded by Jacobs Foundation. NYU-Bahcesehir Collaborative Research Project is an international collaboration to build research capacity and to create an opportunity for Turkish and American students and faculty to better understand each other’s cultures through research and scholarship.

In recent years this question has taken the form of developing a new and more holistic way to think about the research/practice area typically referred to as career development/career counseling. I refer to this new way of thinking as Counseling for Work and Relationship, an approach that addresses how people construct their lives going forward with respect to the major social contexts of market work, unpaid care work, and relationships. Central to this project is the development of a dual model of work for both men and women that includes both paid or market work and unpaid care work. I am also interested in research that identifies the processes by which people construct their life paths. My interests further extend to attempts to integrate counseling and psychotherapy practices to encompass the resolution of psychological problems rooted in the past and the construction of lives going forward.

A common thread throughout her research is the role of governmental and private institutions in facilitating transactions between buyers and sellers, including how food labels transmit unobservable information about product quality to buyers and how policies support farmer income and consumer health. Dr. Dimitri is widely recognized as the leading US expert in the procurement and marketing of organic food, and has published extensively on the distribution, processing, retailing, and consumption of organic food. Since 1998, she has published over 35 papers and reports, and given more than 30 talks, on organic food and agriculture. Her paper “Organic food consumers: What do we really know about them?” received a commendable paper award from the British Food Journal in 2013. She was recently interviewed on why consumers should buy organic food for an article featured in Oprah Magazine. Research in progress includes a study of urban agriculture in the United States, asking whether the urban setting is a profitable venture for farmers and why urban farms choose to form as a nonprofit organization. Dr. Dimitri is also exploring the political economies of the National Organic Standards Board, which is the advisory council that was created under the Organic Foods Production Act of 1990, in terms of board composition and board recommendations. She is currently writing a book tentatively titled The US Food System: Economics and Policy. Recently completed research examined the effectiveness of nutrition incentives, similar to the Food Insecurity Nutrition Incentives included in the Agricultural Act of 2014, on both actual and perceived consumption of fresh produce of low-income consumers. Prior to joining the NYU faculty, Dr. Dimitri worked as a research economist at the Economic Research Service of the US Department of Agriculture.

Raul P. Lejano,Associate Professor,,lejano@nyu.edu,Teaching and Learning,,"Raul Lejano is a scholar in environment, behavior, and collective action, whose foremost interests involve understanding people’s deep engagements with community and environment, and reflecting such in how we design policy and institutions from a relational perspective. His work on urban sustainability involves increasing resilience in vulnerable communities to risks from extreme weather events, environmental health risks, and social disenfranchisement. His research suggests strategies for reforming urban governance around an ethic of care. Current projects include studying resilience to extreme weather in developing nations and analyzing institutional innovation around land reform and environmental governance in China. . Beginning with his first book, Frameworks for Policy Analysis: Merging Text and Context (Routledge), he has developed approaches for integrating multiple analytical lenses in interpreting environmental situations. In his (co-authored) book, The Power of Narrative in Environmental Networks (MIT Press), a theory is advanced regarding the unique capacity of narrative to capture complex human motivations and human-nonhuman relationships. . His work in the area of environmental education emphasizes how ecological knowledge emerges from the capacity of a person to build relationships with others. Since people’s motivations are never merely utilitarian or affective or ethical, policies cannot be so simplistically designed. As an example, cities need to be analyzed not merely in objective terms but as a web of relationships. His latest work involves the role of narrative and relationality in moving people to act on climate change. Lejano received his doctorate in Environmental Health Science in 1998 from UCLA, and held faculty appointments at MIT, UCI, and HKU before coming to the Steinhardt School at NYU. As a doctoral student, he worked with Lloyd Shapley, recipient of the Nobel Prize in economics. ______________________________________ Raul Lejano, PhD, Associate Professor NYU Steinhardt School, 239 Greene Street, Room 424, New York, NY 10003 USA Link to Book: http://mitpress.mit.edu/books/power-narrative-environmental-networks  Link to Book: https://www.routledge.com/Frameworks-for-Policy-Analysis-Merging-Text-and-Context/Lejano/p/book/9780415952767 Chinese Translation (Tsinghua Press): http://item.jd.com/12024656.html  ",https://steinhardt.nyu.edu/scmsAdmin/uploads/008/255/Lejano%20at%20Occupy%20Library%201.jpg,https://steinhardt.nyu.edu/faculty/Raul_Lejano,Environment and society,environmental risks and inequality,,,,,,,,,,,

I am an Associate Professor and Director of International Education at New York University's Steinhardt School of Culture, Education, and Affiliated Faculty with the NYU Wilf Family Politics Department, NYU Abu Dhabi, the NYU Robert F. Wagner School of Public Service, and the Saltzman Institute of War and Peace Studies at Columbia University. My book, Schools for Conflict or for Peace in Afghanistan, recently won the $100,000 2017 Grawemeyer Award for Ideas Improving World Order.   My research focuses on the effects of conflict on education, the efforts of humanitarian organizations to mitigate these effects, and the relationship between education and political violence or peace. I am particularly interested in research that can be used to inform policy and that has the potential to help state and non-state actors create positive social change. I use diverse research methods including qualitative case studies and complex field experiments (also known as randomized controlled trials) that rely on both large-scale surveys and in-depth, qualitative interviews. Before coming to NYU, I was an Associate Research Scholar/Post-Doctoral Fellow at Columbia University's Saltzman Institute of War and Peace Studies (SIWPS) and taught at Teachers College. I received my PhD in Comparative Education and Political Science from Columbia University, Master's in Educational Administration/International Education from Harvard, and a BA in English Literature from Oberlin College.I am currently working on three projects: assessing the learning outcomes and sustainability of community-based schools in Afghanistan as they transition from NGOs to government administration; understanding how youth aspirations and education affect youth participation in public life in Pakistan and Kenya; and learning how boosting community engagement affects performance in community-based schools in remote Afghan villages. The most optimistic findings of my recent work in Afghanistan come from my study of community-based schools in Ghor Province (with Leigh Linden). We find that bringing education to remote Afghan villages eliminates gender disparity in enrollment between girls and boys. In addition these children show significant academic achievement once they are there. To read more about this research, please see “Bringing Education to Afghan Girls: A Randomized Controlled Trial in Afghanistan.”My book, Schools for Conflict or for Peace in Afghanistan, published by Columbia University Press is available here.

Gary Anderson,Professor of Educational Leadership,212-998-5520,gary.anderson@nyu.edu,"Administration, Leadership, and Technology",,"I am a former middle and high school teacher and high school principal. From 1982-1984 I was a high school principal at the Colegio Americano de Puebla. At the university level I have taught courses in Education policy, educational leadership, qualitative research, action research, discourse analysis, organizational theory, politics of education, teacher development, Education advocacy, and the school principalship. My research interests are interdisciplinary and range widely. I am particularly interested in doing research within the tensions between theory and practice in applied fields like education. As a result of this interest, I have co-authored two books on Action Research (Anderson, Herr, and Nihlen, 1994; Herr and Anderson, 2015), and have written extensively on issues of knowledge production in applied fields of study. My most recent work is in the filed of education policy. I am interested in ways educational research might better inform policy and issues of knowledge mobilization generally. I have just published a study on new governance and new policy networks focused on the education task Force of the American Legislative Exchange Council (ALEC) and am currently working on a study of the State Policy Network and its impact on education policy. I have published most extensively in the field of Educational Leadership. My work attempts to refocus the field through the use of critical and poststructural theories, particularly Marx, Habermas, Bourdieu, and Foucault. I have also done research on organizational micropolitics, and more recently on school privatization and the impact of global neoliberalism on education. I have an interest in Education in Latin America and have received two Fulbright awards to do research in Argentina and Mexico. A central concern of my research has been the symbolic dimension of educational leadership and the ways administrators “manage meaning” (ie. dominant discourses) in schools, school districts, and school communities. My dissertation research was an ethnographic study of school principals in which I developed a model that explored how administrators mediate political demands vertically within the hierarchy as well as horizontally among school professionals and the school community. (Anderson 1989, 1990). This research led me to further research that explored school micropolitics - the behind the scenes struggle for power within the informal organization (Blasé and Anderson, 1995; Anderson, 1991) – and the micropolitics of student behavior as they struggle to form academic identities in socially stratified contexts (Anderson, 1996; Anderson and Herr, 1993; Herr and Anderson, 1993, 1997). Part of this study of student voices compared data gathered in the U.S. with data from a Fullbright research award in Puebla, Mexico. Given the growing Mexican student population in New York (mainly from the state of Puebla) I plan to extend this comparative analysis in the future. This research has lead me to a concern with how administrative practices within highly unequal and politicized contexts can shift power to students and communities, particularly in low-income communities of color. I have more recently developed a framework for authentic school-community partnerships (Anderson, 1998) and continue to explore forms of school leadership conducive to equalizing opportunities in urban schools. I explore these issues in my latest book, Advocacy Leadership: Toward a Post-Reform Agenda (2009, Routledge). I have done several studies using discourse analysis of school and policy texts, national standards and licensure exams for administrators, and media accounts (Anderson and Grinberg, 1998; Anderson, 2001a, 2001b, 2004). These studies trace the shifting role of school leaders in the context of “new economy” demands for greater marketization, corporatization and the increasing privatization of public schooling and the public sphere in general.",https://steinhardt.nyu.edu/scmsAdmin/uploads/007/038/Garyphoto.jpg,https://steinhardt.nyu.edu/faculty/Gary_Anderson,Educational leadership,Education policy,,,,,,,,,,,

Shabnam Javdani,Assistant Professor of Applied Psychology,(212) 992-9739,shabnam.javdani@nyu.edu,Applied Psychology,,"Shabnam Javdani is a clinical and community psychologist who examines the development of, and social response to, violence and antisocial behavior. Javdani completed her doctoral work at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign in 2012, and completed an APA-approved clinical internship in the Institute for Juvenile Research at the University of Illinois at Chicago prior to coming to Steinhardt. Her program of research involves three interrelated components. The first examines the etiological pathways that promote disruptive/antisocial behavior in youth and adults. In particular, Javdani investigates the influence of trauma, risky dating relationships, early pubertal development, neighborhood and community resources, and genetic liability. At a more macro level, Javdani also investigates the juvenile and criminal justice systems, and how the response of these systems (e.g., policies and practices) may affect outcomes for youth and adults. The second component of Javdani's research examines the role of gender in health disparities associated with disruptive/antisocial behavior, including self and other-directed violence, the development of Sexually Transmitted Infections, and psychopathology. In the context of this work, Javdani conceptualizes and operationalizes gender as both an individual level attribute and a social grouping category with associated gender norms and roles (e.g., Javdani examines women's subjugated roles in intimate partner relationships as a context in which health disparities may arise). The third component centralizes the development, implementation, and evaluation of interventions for young women and men involved in, or at risk for entry into, the juvenile justice system. Javdani directs NYC ROSES, a strengths-based, youth-centered advocacy approach to target changes in youth's opportunity structures (e.g., through providing access to needed resources) and investigates the extent to which such changes are associated with promotion of positive outcomes (e.g., resilience, academic achievement) and reduction of negative outcomes (e.g., arrest/incarceration, mental health symptoms). In collaboration with the New York City Department of Juvenile Justice, Javdani also designs, implements, and evaluates group and individual-based programs at several detention and placement facilitities. These programs focus on multiple levels and target both youth and settings. Across components, Javdani's program of research is characterized by a social justice focus, with an emphasis on the application of research for the urban poor and in under-resourced communities. Javdani uses a variety of methodological approaches, including quantitative, qualitative, and mixed-methodologies. Research Gate Profile

Catherine Tamis-LeMonda,Professor of Applied Psychology,(212) 998-5399,catherine.tamis-lemonda@nyu.edu,Applied Psychology,,"My research is focused on infant and toddler learning and development in the areas of language and communication, object play, cognition, motor skills, gender identity, emotion regulation, and social understanding, and the long term implications of early emerging skills for children’s developmental trajectories. I investigate how skills in different domains reciprocally affect one another and snowball over time (that is, the theoretical construct of “developmental cascades”), and examine the role of socio-cultural context on skill development and lagged associations. A core emphasis of this research is on the quality of mothers’ and fathers’ interactions with children –in particular their contingent responsiveness and richness of child-directed language – in relation to children’s developmental trajectories and, conversely, how emerging communicative skills in children influence their everyday learning experiences and interactions with parents. Our studies of these bi-directional social processes are examined in children from diverse economic and ethnic backgrounds using longitudinal analyses, naturalistic observations of infant-parent interactions at home, experimental methods in the laboratory, and surveys and qualitative interviews with parents. This work takes place at NYU Steinhardt's Center for Research on Culture, Development, and Education, where a vibrant community of students and faculty work together to advance a deep and nuanced understanding of how learning and development unfolds in different cultural and ethnic groups in the U.S. as well as internationally.

Erin’s first line of research involves perceptions and justifications of social and economic hierarchies and the psychological consequences of inequality. She examines system justification, critical consciousness, attributions for poverty and wealth, and subjective perceptions of social status among youth and their families. Questions guiding this work include: how do people come to justify or criticize social and economic hierarchies? Do they attribute poverty and wealth to individual or structural factors? Why? Where do they place themselves in these hierarchies? Erin examines how beliefs about social and economic hierarchies develop, whether they differ for people who are privileged vs. marginalized by the status quo and what consequences they have for academic outcomes, socioemotional well-being and civic engagement and social change. 2. Erin’s second line of research explores the quality of social service provision meant to improve the lives of disadvantaged families and children. This work uses multilevel methods to rigorously examine characteristics of the social service provision settings (such as welfare offices, schools, juvenile detention centers, and community-based organizations) and their influence on the youth in those settings. Questions guiding this work include: How are social service settings best characterized and measured? What features contribute to a quality setting? Which setting features improve access to services provided and contribute to desired outcomes?

With grants from the National Institute of Mental Health (NIMH) and the Spencer Foundation, she has studied predictors of academic achievement among students at risk for failure, and has designed and examined an intervention to enhance girls' social development and reduce relationally aggressive behavior. With colleagues at the University of Illinois at Chicago Institute for Juvenile Research, and funding from the Institute for Education Sciences, the American Psychological Association, and NIMH, Cappella has worked with school and community partners to implement and study a mental health model focused on learning for disruptive children in high poverty schools. Cappella was awarded an Early Career Research Award from the Society for the Study of School Psychology, and a Community Collaborative Grant from the Steinhardt School of Culture, Education, and Human Development, to adapt and study a teacher consultation model focused on improving classroom processes in urban elementary schools. Within the context of a NIMH-funded developing center (LINKS: Leading Innovations for Neighborhoods, Kids, and Schools) she examined the effectiveness of this program -- BRIDGE -- on classroom interactions and child behaviors in NYC schools. Finally, as a co-PI on an IES efficacy study, Cappella participated in a school-randomized control trial of a theory-based program to align parents and teachers around temperament-based strategies to promote children's behavior and learning. Beyond intervention research, Cappella studies children's social relationships and behaviors in classrooms and schools, with the long-term goal to create ways to activate peer leaders toward the development of positive social environments for learning.
