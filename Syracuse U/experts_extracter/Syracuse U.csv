Since then, he has put this experience into practice in learning, teaching, research, and enterprise.
Over the years Fathers has gained extensive experience in the development of programs and initiatives aimed to enhance the learning and overall experience of design students. Examples of these are developing new programs in product design, including piloting a pass fail model for first-year learning, and  an M.B.A. in design management. In addition to this he developed support systems for entrepreneurial activity, providing facilities and mentoring for recent design graduates via DesignWorks, a university-based, design-based incubator unit. He served as the staff governor from 2010-13. He also was rained and served on a university-wide coaching and mentoring team for faculty in staff.
Fathers’ teaching and learning activity focuses on sustainability, universal design, and design in a development context. His significant research interest in socially responsible design has been developed with the delivery of a number of journal and international conference papers. His registered doctoral research has focused on the role of design education in a development context, which led to a 12-month research sabbatical to India, where he worked alongside local crafts groups to develop appropriate design training strategies to facilitate enterprise development. Outside the university he served as a director between 2006-2013 for Just Add Spice, a London-based social enterprise that develops agency timebanking systems for communities and public services.
Currently Fathers is collaborating with Imagining America on establishing their commission for Publicly Engaged Design, is working with partners in Virginia Tech on the development of the inaugural ACC competition for creative achievement, and was recently the principal investigator for the Blackstone Launchpad, resulting in a $900,000 grant for the University.

These constraints have strong implications for how terrestrial ecosystems may change in the coming century.
Dr. Fridley’s research is strongly interdisciplinary, combining physiology, climatology, biogeography, and biogeochemistry. He has established a geographic context for his experimental work, which has led to key innovations in studying ecosystem development and plant strategy theory.  Dr. Fridley has also pioneered a statistical approach for interpolating climate data to high spatial resolution in montane regions.
His current work involves looking at how the ecosystems have assembled and guided plant evolution in the past in order to understand how these ecosystems will evolve in the future.  In his lab, Dr. Fridley and his team are studying how non-native invasive plants differ from the native plants they often displace, and whether such differences are the result of the contrasting evolutionary histories of the species involved.

He and his team investigate important interactions among these trophic levels, which, in turn, facilitate energy and nutrient flows in Yellowstone grasslands and foster stability of this ecosystem that experiences high chronic levels of grazing.
The Frank Lab utilizes field and laboratory experiments. In the field, he and his team erect ungulate enclosures to create an un-grazed treatment and then compare plant growth and soil processes in grazed versus un-grazed grasslands. In the lab, experiments are conducted in the greenhouse or environmental chambers to determine how mycorrhizae, nutrient availability, and soil microbial composition and diversity may mediate the effect of grazing on plant growth.",http://asfaculty.syr.edu/pages/bio/Frank-Doug.html,https://news.syr.edu/faculty-experts/douglas-a-frank/,https://news.syr.edu/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/frank2.jpg,Grazing Ecosystems,Yellowstone Grasslands,,,,,,,,,,,

Mel White is an expert in creative visual advertising and gender diversity in advertising agency creative departments – for the former, White has most recently investigated in a paper and conference presentation titled “Tracing the Emergence and Dominance of Visual Solution Advertising: A Preliminary Study”.  For the latter, White has partnered with fellow Newhouse Assistant Professor, Rebecca Ortiz, for a mixed-methods study that will entail the compiling and analysis of personnel data from dozens of NYC advertising agencies and performing semi-structured interviews with a cross-section of creative department staff at a few NYC agencies.  The study seeks to investigate a commonly quoted statistic that the creative leadership at ad agencies is, on average, 11% women and 89% men, while also exploring the factors and obstacles that women creatives report that make it difficult or nearly impossible for them to obtain creative leadership positions at advertising agencies.
Before being recruited to teach Creative Advertising at Newhouse, White spent more than 25 years in advertising – 17 of these years as a veteran of the New York City advertising scene where she worked as a creative director/art director at top agencies such as Young & Rubicam, Ogilvy, Grey, Publicis and D’Arcy. 
She has worked on a range of accounts from packaged goods to technology on many high-profile brands such as Microsoft, Land Rover, MINI Cooper, Crest, Dannon, American Express, Lea & Perrins, Miller, Xerox, Dell, Sony, Bounty, Green Mountain Coffee, Hillshire Farm, Old El Paso, Cellular South, Sleep Number, Fisher-Price, Capitol One, Always, Pillsbury, Swiffer, UNCF and Search Dog Foundation.

Specifically, she examines predictors of relationship outcomes, most notably dissolution behaviors and health outcomes, as well as the processes associated with these outcomes. She is the director of the Interdependent Relationships Laboratory.
Her research currently focuses on why people leave their relationships. This deceptively simple question has dominated Dr. VanderDrift’s thinking and work to date. In this work, she researches what process occurs that moves individuals from experiencing flagging commitment to actually leaving their relationships. She has developed a construct called dissolution consideration to encapsulate the increased salience of dissolution that people experience just prior to leaving their relationship. Subsequently, she has examined myriad processes associated with dissolution, including:
-the process by which need fulfillment is associated with stay-leave behavior, finding that personal needs promote commitment, whereas relational needs are directly associated with stay-leave behavior (VanderDrift & Agnew, 2012).
-whether valuing the friendship component of a romance more than other aspects is associated with relationship persistence. It is. (VanderDrift, Wilson, & Agnew, 2013; VanderDrift, Lehmiller, & Kelly, 2012)

Christopher A. Scholz,Professor of Earth Sciences,,,,,"Dr. Scholz’s research focuses on recovering records of past climate from lake basins, and on the sedimentary basin analysis of extensional systems, with emphasis on lacustrine basins. Current research efforts are concentrated on the large lakes of tropical Africa and the Finger Lakes of Central New York. Lake basins contain some of the highest quality archives of climate change on the continents, and new drill core records from the low-latitude lakes of Africa are revealing new details about the Pleistocene record of climate change.
The world’s large rift valley lakes are outstanding laboratories for understanding the interaction of tectonic, climatic, and depositional processes, and are particularly useful for developing models for hydrocarbon exploration in ancient rift systems. These large, deep lakes contain thick accumulations of sediment dating back millions of years, and are among the best places on the continents for reconstructing past climates. Recent field programs have involved scientific drilling in tropical lake basins, the recovery of high-resolution sediment cores from lakes, and the imaging of sedimentary lake basins at various scales, using seismic reflection datasets techniques.",,https://news.syr.edu/faculty-experts/christopher-a-scholz/,https://news.syr.edu/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/chris_scholz.jpg,climate change,,,,,,,,,,,,

Fully understanding memory requires the development of models that account for a range of tasks and a range of effects. In particular, Dr. Criss and her research associates build computer models to mimic the human memory system and understand the processes that underline human episodic memory. A multidisciplinary approach spanning experimental psychology, gerontology, computational science, and cognitive neuroscience lays the  groundwork for a unified mechanistic account of memory.
Empirical and theoretical accounts of memory have been advanced by adopting multiple techniques and employing sophisticated analysis of response time  distributions to evaluate models of memory. This unique approach has the potential to revolutionize the field of memory. Her research has application in criminal justice and educational testing by understanding the properties of effective memory cues.
